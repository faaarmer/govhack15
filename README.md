Naya is an open data project that helps people identify disaster prone areas on a map and check the safety of family members and friends during a natural disaster.

Users are able to view disasters such as bushfires and floods, and easily locate where fire and SES emergency services are.

Locating and knowing the safety of family members and friends are crucial during times of crises, and users are able to do this easily with a click of a button with Naya. Family members are able to respond using their mobile phone which appears on the map, indicating whether they are safe or if they need help.

Embracing the principle of open data, the safety status of other users in the app are anonymously shown on the map, enabling emergency services to efficiently distribute resources to places where help is needed most.
